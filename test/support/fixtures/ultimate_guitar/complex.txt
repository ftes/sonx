[Verse 1]
             Bb                   Gm7             F
Christ is my firm foundation, the rock on which I stand
                 Bb          Eb           Gm              F
When everything around me is shaken, I've never been more glad
              Eb              Bb/D Gm           F
That I put my faith in Jesus, He's never let me down
                      Eb           Bb/D Gm7               F
He's faithful through generations, so   why would He fail now

[Chorus 1]
          Bb
He won't, He won't

[Verse 2]
               Bb                     Gm7                 F
I've still got joy in chaos, I've got peace that makes no sense
           Eb    Bb/D           Gm             F
I won't be going under, I'm not held by my own strength
                     Eb             Bb/D Gm    F/A Bb F
'Cause I've built my life on Jesus, He's never let me down
                 Eb            Bb/D Gm                F
He's faithful in every season, so   why would He fail now

[Chorus 2]
          Bb
He won't, He won't
         Gm F            Gm F
He won't fa il, He won't fa il

[Bridge]
Eb            F             Bb/D                  Gm F
Rain came and wind blew but my house was built on You
Eb       F         Bb/D                 Gm     F
I'm safe with You, I'm going to make it through
