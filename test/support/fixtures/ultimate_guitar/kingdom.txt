[Verse 1]
   Dm7              C/E                  F
My heart has always longed for something more
  Dm7                   Bb                F
I searched the stars to knock on Heaven's door
Dm7            Bb            F
Every wound we carry will be healed
               G7/B                   Bbm
My eyes on the Son, Lord Your will be done

[Chorus]
             Gm  F                   Dm
Thine is the Kingdom, the power, the glory
            Gm F                   Dm
Forever and e  ver, He finished my story
              Gm  F/A
We're singing freedom, our testimony
                    Gm7/C  F
We'll be singing forever, amen

[Verse 2]
Dm7            C/E           F
Beautiful each color that He made
     Dm7             Bb         F
Your love's the only remedy for hate
Dm7              C/E               F
You'll return to set the pris'ners free
     Dm7               Bb               F
'Til then Your will on Earth be done in me
               G7/B                   Bbm
My eyes on the Son, Lord Your will be done

Dm7       C/E           F    Bb
If you've ever wondered what Heaven looks like
Dm7 C/E                  F      Bb
    It's looking like me and you
Dm7       C/E             F    Bb
If you've ever questioned what Heaven sounds like
Dm7 C/E              F       Bb
    Just let it fill the room
