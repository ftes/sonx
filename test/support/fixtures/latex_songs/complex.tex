\beginsong{Firm Foundation \\ He Won't}[by={Cody Carnes}]




\capo{3}


\beginverse
Christ is my \[Bb]firm foundation, the \[Gm7]rock on which I \[F]stand
When everything a\[Bb]round me is \[Eb]shaken, I've \[Gm]never been more \[F]glad
That I put my \[Eb]faith in Jesus, \[Bb/D]He's \[Gm]never let me \[F]down
He's faithful through \[Eb]generations, \[Bb/D]so \[Gm7]why would He fail \[F]now
\endverse

\beginchorus
He won't, \[Bb]He won't
\endchorus

\beginverse
I've still got \[Bb]joy in chaos, I've got \[Gm7]peace that makes no \[F]sense
I won't be \[Eb]going \[Bb/D]under, I'm not \[Gm]held by my own \[F]strength
'Cause I've built my \[Eb]life on Jesus, \[Bb/D]He's \[Gm]never \[F/A]let \[Bb]me \[F]down
He's faithful in \[Eb]every season, \[Bb/D]so \[Gm]why would He fail \[F]now
\endverse

\beginchorus
He won't, \[Bb]He won't
He won't \[Gm]fa\[F]il, He won't \[Gm]fa\[F]il
\endchorus


\[Eb]Rain came and \[F]wind blew but \[Bb/D]my house was built on \[Gm]You \[F]
\[Eb]I'm safe \[F]with You, \[Bb/D]I'm going to make it \[Gm]through \[F]
